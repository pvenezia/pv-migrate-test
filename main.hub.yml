This hub pulls together data from several other sources (like the main.oas2 file in this project) to render its content.\n3. Open the project file explorer by clicking the file icon in the left gutter.\n4. Click through the files to view their editors and make changes. Each file has an extension that indicates its type.\n5. Stoplight currently supports 5 extensions:\n\t- .hub: Technical documentation.\n\t- .oas2: API Design + Modeling.\n\t- .scenarios: API Testing + Orchestration.\n\t- .prism: API Mocking + Validation.\n\t- .md: Snippets of documentation.\n\t- _.oas3: Coming Soon!_\n\n__If you make changes to any of the files, don't forget to click the \"Save\" button, located in the top left of the editors.__"

              There are various files displayed in the file explorer to the
              left, organized by type (click file button in gutter if you don't
              see the list).


              1. **Modeling**: Get started with our OAS/Swagger editor.

              2. **Scenarios**: Create API tests (and contract tests!) with our
              Scenarios editor.

              3. **Prism**: Create different types of servers (mocking,
              validation, etc) with Prism.


              **Bonus**: Connect your files together with references to
              supercharge them!

            ## Testing


            - The tests.scenarios in this project leverages the main.oas2 file
            to power its contract testing.

            - _NOTE_: The todo-partial model in the main.oas2 file intentially
            includes a required “user” property that will cause the tests to
            fail. This is because the actual todos.stoplight.io API does not
            return a user property. Try it out by navigating to the
            tests.scenarios file and running the collection!


            ## Modeling Features


            - This project includes two OAS2 (Swagger 2) files - common.oas2 and
            main.oas2.

            - This main.oas2 leverages the JSON Schema allOf property
            (inheritance), shared parameters (common query string), and shared
            responses (common error codes).

            - This main.oas2 specification references data defined in the
            common.oas2 specification. Check out the “user” property in the
            todo-full model. It references the common.oas2 file in this project,
            but could easily reference a file in another project. This lets you
            build up shared libraries of data for your organization.

            - You can quickly send requests to the To-dos API by clicking the
            “HTTP Request Maker” tab at the bottom of the modeling editor.

            - While the HTTP Request Maker is open, you can navigate through
            operations in the editor sidebar to quickly update the request from
            your OAS specification.

            - If you have prism files in this project, you can select their host
            to send requests to them instead. Try sending a request to the
            mock.prism instance, its running a mock API based on this
            specification!

                  This API Reference shows how you can pull in OAS2 (Swagger)
                  data that is managed outside of this hub.


                  - The To-dos API data is being fetched from the main.oas2 file
                  in this project.

                  - The Giphy API data is being fetched from a GitHub Gist.


                  This makes it easy for other teams or processes (code
                  generation, etc) to update your OpenAPI files. Whenever they
                  are updated, this hub will be updated - easy as pie!

                  see how the To-do and Giphy APIs are setup.
