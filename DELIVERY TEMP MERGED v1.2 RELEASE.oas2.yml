  title: DTS Connected Radio API
  description: >-
    This is the DTS Connected Radio API, designed to provide static and dynamic
    metadata for global analog and digital radio broadcasts, in addition to
    enhanced services supporting an advanced radio experience.


    This API is referred to as the CONRAD API throughout the documentation.


    API interaction is available via SSL/TLS encryption only, and the use of
    HTTP compression is highly encouraged to reduce data consumption.


    If a key specified in the API spec is missing from a response, the value
    should be assumed `null`. All booleans will have default values specified in
    the documentation if they are not present in a response.

      The format is `{deviceId},{hash}`, where the `hash` is
      `HMAC_SHA256(mfgSecret, deviceId)`.

      The `hash` is hex digest, truncated to 24 characters.

      Example: `Authorization: asdbh23456sdf,fd9f655862c9bd4da0edb845`


      `mfgId` is also required, and is assigned by DTS during production rollout
      planning.


      Example: `mfgId: ABCDEF123456`
  mfgId:
    type: apiKey
    name: mfgId
    in: header
    description: >-
      The `mfgId` is assigned by DTS. It is required to be present as a header
      in every request made to the API. The format is the `mfgId` as a string.
      Example: `DEV-0001`. The IDs used in sandbox will not work in production.

      description: >-
        Register a device and receive a unique device ID assigned by the API.
        This ID is assigned to each device once, during the first contact with
        the API. This device ID is retained by the client and used in all
        subsequent API interactions. The device ID is also used in the
        authentication process.


        If a client does not have a valid API-assigned device ID present in
        non-volatile storage, the first API interaction shall be to register and
        receive this ID.


        This request should only be made when the client is first initialized or
        if the client is reset to factory defaults.

            Authorization header. Please note that this authentication signature
            is different from all other Authorization headers in the API in that
            it uses `mfgId` not `deviceId` as the `deviceId` has not yet been
            acquired.

            The format is `{mfgId},{hash}`, where the `hash` is
            `HMAC_SHA256(mfgSecret, mfgId)`.

            The `hash` is hex digest, truncated to 24 characters.

        pertaining to API interaction. The values for keys in this object may
        change depending on the geographical location of the client, or when the

        Clients should never hard-code values that are present in a `/config`
        response, they are to be updated whenever a new `/config` response is
        received, which may occur periodically during normal operation.

        Retrieves a list of `Broadcast` objects from a location query,
        frequencies, GCC/ensemble IDs pairs, or GCC/piCode pairs.


        This is the general query type, designed to be used by most clients with
        access to one or more tuners.


        The majority of the queries to this path will be latitude and longitude
        only, but extended query types for different broadcast technologies are
        supported.


        This method accepts a query with required coordinates and further data
        on stations that are available based on tuner reception. This may
        include purely analog frequencies or DAB GCC and ensemble ID pairs, or
        GCC and PI code pairs. The API will return a list of stations based on
        the data presented in the query. The more descriptive data the client
        can deliver in the query, the more accurate the resulting broadcast list
        will be.


        The minimum query components are lat/lng and deviceId.


        The result is an array of objects, each with a unique identifier, and
        broadcast details related to their broadcast technology. The list may be
        contain broadcast definitions representing multiple different broadcast
        technologies. All results are best-effort, and objects may contain only
        minimal data -- not every pair in the object may be populated or present
        for every object in a response array.

      description: >-

        ***Note: Data from the `/broadcasts/{broadcastId}/live` path is
        currently available for thousands of North American broadcasts, and
        selected cities in Europe and Asia, such as Berlin, Germany; London, UK;
        Paris, France; Tokyo, Japan; and Seoul, South Korea. Live data for other
        geographic regions is coming.***


        The `/broadcasts/{broadcastId}/live` path retrieves live/now-playing
        data objects for a specific broadcast ID. This is the path that is
        called when a client needs data on what content is currently playing on
        a specfic broadcast for purposes of displaying song or program
        information, album art, and other data if that data exists for that
        broadcast.


        This path is to be used when triggered by the message queue
        notifications for this broadcast. The AMQP connection URI is specified
        in `Broadcasts#broadcastData.mqURI`, along with `mqKey` and
        `mqExchange`.  The message queue push data is in the form of
        `broadcastId,liveId`. Upon receiving the message via the AMQP queue, the
        client should call `/broadcasts/{broadcastId}/live` to retrieve the live
        data object.


        This method is not intended to be polled at timed intervals or used
        without subscription to the AMQP queue and routing key for a specific
        broadcast. It may be used for a single snapshot of data for a station or
        small set of stations to enhance a station guide display.


        However, a call to `/broadcasts/{broadcastId}/live` should be made prior
        to subscribing to the message queue for a specific broadcast in order to
        retrieve current data before subscribing to receive notifications to
        retrieve new data.


        If a client is disconnected from the AMQP service, it should attempt to
        reconnect and subscribe to the routing key again. In addition, it should
        request `/broadcasts/{broadcastId}/live` immediately to ensure that the
        latest available live data is presented. If reconnection is not possible
        for an extended length of time, then the client should cease presenting
        live data until the connection can be resumed.


        Not all broadcast IDs will have a live data feed. See the key
        `hasLiveData` in each station record in a response to a `/broadcasts`
        query.


        If the response to a GET is `202 Accepted`, then the client is to wait
        for config parameter `liveDataRetry` seconds before retrying the GET.
        This is because we may need to gather the requested data from other
        sources and techniques that require several seconds to complete.


        If this path returns a `404 Not Found`, no live data is currently
        available for that `broadcastId`.

        This path allows the client to submit service usage reports to the API
        containing data on broadcasts and other media consumption.


        This report is to be submitted on a scheduled basis as determined by the
        `reportsMinInterval` and `reportsMaxInterval` values in the `/config`
        response. Data collected by the client within those time limits is then
        submitted to the API and a new report is begun.


        If a report has not been successfully submitted within the elapsed time
        specified in the `reportsMaxInterval` value, then the report is
        discarded and a new report begun. If the report size exceeds
        `reportsMaxSize` before submission, then the report is discarded and a
        new report begun.

      description: >-
        This path provides search functions for IP content, such as audio
        streams and podcasts. The `search` parameter is the text string to
        match, and the `type` parameter can be used to select only `streams`, or
        only `podcasts`. The default is to return all types.


        Pagination is required, and handled by cursors. To navigate to the next
        set of results, query with `cursor` set to the value of `cursors[next]`.
        Optionally, add a `limit` parameter to define the number of results to
        return starting at that cursor. The maximum is 10 per response.

        This path retrieves category information, paths, and lists of streams
        and podcasts that reside in those categories. When called with a single
        `/` as the `ipcCatPath` path parameter, it will return the highest-level
        (root) categories, and include the `ipcCatPath` parameters to navigate
        to the listed categories. If there are no child categories within a
        category path, a list of IP Content objects pertaining to the selected
        category will be returned.


        Categories can be defined and updated at any time. 


        Pagination is required, and handled by cursors. To navigate to the next
        set of results, query with `cursor` set to the value of `cursors[next]`.
        Optionally, add a `limit` parameter to define the number of results to
        return starting at that cursor. The maximum is 10 per response.

        If there are one or more live content streams or podcasts associated

        Pagination is required, and handled by cursors. To navigate to the next
        set of results, query with `cursor` set to the value of `cursors[next]`.
        Optionally, add a `limit` parameter to define the number of results to
        return starting at that cursor. The maximum is 10 per response.

        Pagination is required, and handled by cursors. To navigate to the next

        return starting at that cursor. The maximum is 10 per response.

        Pagination is required, and handled by cursors. To navigate to the next
        set of results, query with `cursor` set to the value of `cursors[next]`.
        Optionally, add a `limit` parameter to define the number of results to
        return starting at that cursor. The maximum is 10 per response.

      description: >
        Search functions for local events related to broadcast information such
        as broadcast genre or live data such as artist name. Supported genres
        are aligned with the response from the `/genres` path and are referenced
        by ID.


        Ex.
        `https://a.sandbox.cnrd.io/localevents/search?lat=37.774&lng=-122.419&type=artistEvents&artistName=Charlie%20Hunter&range=20mi`


        Pagination is required, and handled by cursors. To navigate to the next
        set of results, query with `cursor` set to the value of `cursors[next]`.
        Optionally, add a `limit` parameter to define the number of results to
        return starting at that cursor. The maximum is 10 per response.

      moved/combined with another `broadcastId`, and the client should update
      any presets, favorites, or bookmarks that reference this `broadcastId`
      with the target of the redirection specified as `newBroadcastId` in the
      200 reponse.
