            # Welcome to your new hub. 


            Its kind of empty in here - click the **"Design"** button at the top
            of the editor to switch to edit mode to add new pages, content, and
            subpages!


            Use references to power parts of your Hub with other files in this
            project (like Modeling/OAS/Swagger files).
